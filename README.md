This project demonstrates the integration of **Tox**, **Nox**, **Poetry**, **CI/CD** and **Pytest** to validate
Python projects across multiple Python versions. This is specially useful for shared libs projects
and multi-user environments projects.

## Features

- Example functions for addition and subtraction.
- Unit testing on tht with `pytest`.
- Dependency and environment management with `Poetry`.
- Multi-version Python application testing with `Tox`, `Nox` and `CI/CD` (Gitlab and GitHub Actions).

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wallaceespindola/tox-nox-python-tests.git
cd tox-nox-python-tests
```

### Install Poetry

```bash
pip install poetry
```

### Install Dependencies (listed in pyproject.toml)

```bash
poetry install
```

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
poetry run pytest --verbose
```

### Run Tox

```bash
poetry run tox
```

Example output:

### Run Nox

```bash
poetry run nox
```

Example output:
