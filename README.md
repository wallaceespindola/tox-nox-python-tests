# Using Tox and Nox for Multiple Python Versions Validation

This project demonstrates the integration of **Tox**, **Nox**, **Poetry**, **CI/CD** and **Pytest** to validate 
Python projects across multiple Python versions. This is specially useful for shared libs projects 
and multi-user environments projects.

## Features

- Example functions for addition and subtraction.
- Unit testing on tht with `pytest`.
- Dependency and environment management with `Poetry`.
- Multi-version Python application testing with `Tox`, `Nox` and `CI/CD` (Gitlab and GitHub Actions).

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wallaceespindola/tox-nox-python-tests.git
cd tox-nox-python-tests
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
poetry run pytest --verbose
```

### Run Tox

```bash
poetry run tox
```

### Run Nox

```bash
poetry run nox
```

### References

This project was created to showcase how to validate Python projects across multiple Python versions using Tox and Nox
for automated testing, with dependency and environment management powered by Poetry. It includes unit tests written with
Pytest.
